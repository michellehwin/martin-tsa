    <h1 class="pb-4">Impact</h1>
    <p>In the spring of 2019, we graduated our first class of 109 students. All students are entering either college or the military. One-third of the students are continuing their education at the University of Texas at Arlington. We also have
      students attending The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon, Notre Dame, University of Texas, Texas A&M and many others. Students earned $4.75 million in scholarships, 861 hours at UTA with a class GPA of 3.48. The STEM
      Academy offers all three Project Lead the Way pathways of Biomedical Science, Engineering, and Computer Science. We have students in both engineering and biomedical internships. Several students have participated in college research
      opportunities with UTA. We also have many students participating in STEM-related clubs and organizations – Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA), robotics, Solar Car Challenge, autonomous vehicle, and roboboat.</p>

    <p>To date, we have just over 500 students enrolled in the Academy. We expanded the program this year from admitting 125 to 170 freshmen. This year we added the Project Lead the Way computer science curriculum to our program. We have 79 juniors
      and seniors attending dual credit classes at UTA. We are excited about continuing to grow and to add opportunities for our students.</p>

        <h2>Mr. Hovey</h2>
        <p>The best part of the STEM Academy is the relationships you develop with your peer STEM students and the teachers. Not only will you be educated, but you will have shared experiences and develop some life long relationships that will help
          you both in college and your career to follow.
        </p>
        <div></div>
        <h2>Mr. Ogg</h2>
        <p>I teach Principles of Engineering to students of the STEM Academy. STEM provides rigorous content to students who are up to the challenge. In addition to this, the pursuit of specialized pathways allows students to experiment with
          different STEM fields before they commit to one in their post-secondary education, saving them both time and money.
        </p>
        <h2>Mrs. Varner</h2>
        <p>My role is that of STEM Coordinator. I help to run the entire program at Martin. I am involved with students, teachers and adminstrators. I actually work as a teacher and an administrator. Our first large population of STEM workers is
          retiring. These are individuals who became involved through the space race and the beginnings of the computer era. We are needing to replace these individuals to maintain a competitive and cutting edge place in the world. We can make a
          difference in the world through STEM
        </p>
        <h2>Ms. Helgren</h2>
        <p>The STEM education is important because it allows the students to focus on their strength (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) while finding their​passion. Ideally, the students graduate high school knowing what they are good at and
          what they are passionate about. The STEM Academy helps our students to future develop their technical and interpersonal skills. I have no doubt that most of our STEM Academy students will go on to see success in college and their career to
          follow. </p>
        <h2>Ms. Henson</h2>
        <p>The community that the STEM program has created is something to be coveted. Students who struggle together and work together towards a common goal are far more likely to be successful in their future endeavors.</p>
        <h2>Ms. Berry</h2>
        <p>The STEM Academy exposes the students to a wide variety of experiences they would not have if they were not a member of the STEM Academy. From trips to NASA, to guest speakers and opportunities to get involved with competitive academic and
          engineering teams...all of these opportunities were born from the creation of the STEM Academy. The STEM Academy also sets the student up for success with internship opportunities with major Fortune 500 companies. Not only do the students
          get paid, but they gain real life exposure to STEM related careers while being mentored within the corporate world.
