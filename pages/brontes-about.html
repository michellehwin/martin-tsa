				<p class="p-col mx-lg-5">
					Here at Brontes Automotive, we’ve made it our mission to facilitate a global movement toward sustainable energy. The Earth is deteriorating, and it’s our duty to preserve it. With emissions and air pollution on the rise, it’s evident that gasoline cars are not contributing to the solution.
				</p>
				<p class = "p-col mx-lg-5">
					With this in mind, electric cars are the ideal answer to our vehicle emissions. Brontes’ vehicles are made to transition the world to a zero-emission future. Not only are these cars eco friendly, but they are powerful. The tradeoffs from gasoline to electric cars have become nonexistent. Study after study, our cars prove to be, in actuality, superior to gasoline cars. Our cars excel in all categories from speed to safety. This is the start of the transportation we need. Brontes will only continue to grow and enhance its technology as we find the best route to a better future.

					<p class="p-col mx-lg-5">
						Founded in 2001, Brontes has always aspired to discover new and innovative ways of using sustainable energy. The founders not only wanted to prove that electric cars could compete with gasoline but even replace them. Years of research and planning would happen before our first car release in 2003. The vehicles were an immediate success and revealed cutting-edge electric technology. The original model swept the market and ranked extremely high among all categories.

					</p>
					<p class = "p-col mx-lg-5">
						Since then, we have only expanded, and now sell four world-class vehicles. These cars have proven to be the best among all, breaking records from fastest acceleration to the furthest range. Electric cars are not only becoming better but more affordable and accessible. Brontes continues to shatter the world’s expectations for electric vehicles and push the horizons for technology.
